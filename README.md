# Statistics
Grading Work for Statistics as well as for Human-Computer Interaction, for my Information System Software Development course.

-- Goal
This is a double-goal project, since responds to the Statistics professor's Assignment of an statistical progam that calculates the basic statistical means (mean, media, moda, etc.), as well as the HCI project of an hypothetic progam, and building a user interface with proper user experience, usability and other items related to HCI.

-- Characteristics
- web interface
- 100% HTML and JavaScript
- Almost keyboard-driven (working on it)
- some __intelligence__ while processing data, to determine the output table type
- good UX and proven UI
- self-explanatory: if you know what is it talking about, there's no need of a manual or instructions
